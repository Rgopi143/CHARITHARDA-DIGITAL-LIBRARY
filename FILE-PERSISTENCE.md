# File Persistence and Access Guide

## ✅ All Files Are Persisted and Accessible

Your Digital Library now ensures that **all uploaded files and images are stored permanently** and can be opened at any time.

## 🔒 How Files Are Stored

### MongoDB GridFS Storage
- Files are stored in **MongoDB GridFS** (a distributed file system)
- All files are saved with unique IDs that never change
- Files persist even if the server restarts
- Files persist even if the browser refreshes

### File Storage Features
- ✅ **Permanent Storage**: Files never expire
- ✅ **Unique IDs**: Each file gets a unique MongoDB ObjectId
- ✅ **Metadata**: Original name, type, size, and upload date are preserved
- ✅ **Content Type**: Proper MIME types for images, videos, PDFs, etc.
- ✅ **Cache Headers**: Files are cached for fast access
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling ensures files don't get lost

## 🖼️ Image and File Access

### Inline Display
- Images open directly in the browser
- Videos play inline with controls
- PDFs display in embedded viewer
- Other files can be downloaded

### Download Support
- Click "Download" to save files locally
- Files maintain their original names
- Different file types are properly handled

## 🔄 How It Works

### Upload Process
1. File is uploaded to server
2. Saved to MongoDB GridFS with unique ID
3. Metadata stored (name, type, size, date)
4. File ID returned to frontend
5. Frontend stores file ID in localStorage

### Access Process
1. Frontend requests file by ID
2. Server looks up file in MongoDB
3. File streamed back to browser
4. Browser displays/downloads based on type

## 📁 File Types Supported

### Images

- Plays inline with controls

### Documents
- PDF - Inline viewer
- Word (DOC, DOCX) - Download
- Excel (XLS, XLSX) - Download
- PowerPoint (PPT, PPTX) - Download

### Archives

### Code Files
- JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C++, etc.

### Audio
- MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC

## 🚀 Access Your Files Anytime

### Requirements
- Server must be running on port 3001
- MongoDB must be running and connected
- Files are stored in the database, not on disk

### File Persistence
- Files persist in MongoDB database
- Files are not affected by browser cache
- Files can be accessed from any device on the network
- Files remain available until explicitly deleted

## 🛠️ File Management

### View Files
- Go to "My Documents" tab
- All uploaded files are listed
- Files are grouped by type
- Search functionality available

### Download Files
- Click "Download" button
- File downloads with original name
- Maintains original file type

### Delete Files
- Click "Remove" button
- Confirmation prevents accidental deletion
- Files are permanently removed from database

### Clear All Files
- Click "Clear All" button
- Removes all files from database
- Requires confirmation

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Files Not Showing
- Refresh the page
- Check MongoDB connection
- Check server logs for errors

### Cannot Open File
- Verify file type is supported
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure server is running

### File Access Denied
- Check MongoDB is running
- Verify database connection
- Check server logs

## 📊 Database Schema

Files are stored in MongoDB with:
- **files.files** collection: File metadata
- **files.chunks** collection: File data chunks
- Each file has:
  - Unique ObjectId
  - Original filename
  - Content type (MIME)
  - File size
  - Upload date
  - Metadata

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Keep MongoDB Running**: Files are in the database
2. **Backup Database**: Regularly backup MongoDB for file safety
3. **Monitor Storage**: GridFS can store large files
4. **Clean Up**: Remove unused files to save space
5. **Organize**: Use descriptive filenames
